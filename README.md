ALU Regex Data Extraction Project
Welcome to my Regex Data Extraction Project! This project is part of the Frontend Web Development - Regex Onboarding Hackathon at ALU. The goal is to use Regular Expressions (Regex) to extract specific types of data from strings. This is a crucial skill for processing and validating data in web development.
