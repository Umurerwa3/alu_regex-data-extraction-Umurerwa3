ALU Regex Data Extraction Project
Welcome to my Regex Data Extraction Project! This project is part of the Frontend Web Development - Regex Onboarding Hackathon at ALU. The goal is to use Regular Expressions (Regex) to extract specific types of data from strings. This is a crucial skill for processing and validating data in web development.

Project Overview

In this project, I implemented regex patterns to extract the following types of data from strings:

 1.Email Addresses

 2.URLs

 3.Phone Numbers

 4.HTML Tags

The project is implemented in JavaScript, and the results are demonstrated using random inputs and test cases.

How It Works

In this project, I created regex patterns to identify and extract specific data types from strings. Hereâ€™s what each regex does:

	1.Email Addresses:Extracts emails like user@example.com or firstname.lastname@company.co.uk.

	2.URLs:Extracts URLs like https://www.example.com or http://subdomain.example.org/page.

	3.Phone Numbers:Extracts phone numbers in various formats, such as (123) 456-7890, 123-456-7890, or 123.456.7890.

	4.HTML Tags:Extracts HTML tags like <p>, <div class="example">, or <img src="image.jpg" alt="description">.
